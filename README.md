# Youtube resolution setter extension

This Chrome extension tries to set Youtube video resolution to the one
given in the dropdown menu, or the highest possible if that one is not available.

## Why?

Sometimes Youtube would not load the highest possible resolution for
me automatically, so I decided to make this extension😁
